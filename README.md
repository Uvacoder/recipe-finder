## Overview

Forkify is an idea that came from Jonas Schmedtmann's Javascript course. I redesigned and used the following tech stack to develop this project:

- ReactJS
- Redux toolkit
- styled-components
- Storybook
- Forkify API provided by Jonas

Live demo: https://chaaals-forkify-v2.vercel.app/
